# Skyward
Banished to the depths of Ziel's fortress, a lone Antek must battle hordes of enemies and reach the top of the fortress to reclaim his freedom and "self."

No two playthroughs will be the same as each level is randomly generated, making each path a new one to explore. Use your magic to eradicate enemies and defeat powerful mini-bosses to uncover new levels. Are you able to ascend Ziel's fortress and vanquish him once and for all?
